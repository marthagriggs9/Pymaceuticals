# Pymaceuticals

Module 5 Challenge

## Summary

The following data is from Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. The medications contained in this data are potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. The mice involved in this study have been identified as having SCC tumors and have been receiving treatment with various drug regimens over the course of 45 days. Pymaceuticals Inc. wishes to compare the performance of one of their drugs, Capomulin, against other drugs in the study. 

## Analysis

* The distribution of female and male mice in this study(49% and 51% respectively), was almost equal, meaning the sex of the mice might not be a significant variable to the study. 
* The box plot shows that across the four regimens selected (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin), Capomulin and Ramicane tend to have smaller final tumor volumes than the other treament regimens. Ramicane appears to have a lower final tumor volume of the four, however the number of mice treated by Ramicane is slightly less that Capomulin (see bar charts). To get a more accurate conclusion, the treament of both regimens may need to be continued on the same number of mice. 
* For the Capomulin treatment group, there is a strong positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume. This showed that they heavier the mouse, the bigger the tumor volume. The r-squared was 0.71, so we could infer that the final tumor volume could be predicted based on the average weight of a mouse. 
* When looking at the Capomulin treatment for mouse 'g316', the tumor volume peaked at day 25 before decreasing in size suddenly between days 40 and 45. The highest timepoint (number of days) in this study was 45, so continuing the length of the treatment for mice on Capomulin may show a continued decrease in tumor volume.
